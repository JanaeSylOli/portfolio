            <h1>The Journey from Crayons</h1>
            <p>In this conceptual photograph for my school project, we see a dynamic of crayons that serve as the foundation of my artistic journey which has since transitioned into digital artistry through code. The sharpness of the image on the crayons at the forefront, with their bright, broken tips, signifies the initial, tactile phase of my creativity. It's a vivid, sensory world where art is a physical, hands-on experience. As the image fades into the soft blur of the background, it represents the gradual shift to the intangible yet boundless possibilities of creating art with code. This evolution from the raw, colorful beginnings to the language of digital creation mirrors my growth as an artist, encapsulating the transition from manual dexterity to digital fluency. Through this visual metaphor, I illustrate the contrast between the simplicity of crayon on paper and the sophistication of pixels on a screen, highlighting the transformative power of technology in the expression of contemporary art.</p>
