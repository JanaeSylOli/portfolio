            <h1>Framed Steps</h1>
            <p>Captured through a handcrafted heart, this image from my school project in conceptual photography depicts a pair of pristine white sneakers, a universal symbol of movement and personal journey, resting on a soft, textured rug. The intentional framing invites the viewer to look at these ordinary objects with affection and curiosity. It's a snapshot that merges warmth with the anticipation of travel, the coziness of home with the allure of exploration.  Through this playful yet intimate lens, I aim to evoke a sense of nostalgia and whimsy, encouraging others to consider the mundane artifacts of daily life as tokens of their own narratives.</p>
