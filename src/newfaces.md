            <h1>Afro-Futurism: New Faces Exhibit</h1>
            <p>"New Faces Exhibit" is a captivating portfolio piece that represents my venture into Afro-futurism through a museum entry project completed during my academic studies. This composition harmoniously melds the tradition of portraiture with cosmic elements to project an imaginative future where culture and identity extend beyond the confines of Earth. Utilizing Adobe Illustrator, I meticulously crafted the vector outlines to achieve crisp, clean lines and shapes, providing a solid foundation for the artwork. Then, with Adobe Photoshop, I added depth, texture, and a rich tapestry of colors that breathed life into the piece. The result is a blend of digital precision and artistic fluidity that transports the viewer into a celestial narrative, reflecting my skills in digital tools and my vision for a future where art transcends time and space. This piece not only showcases my technical proficiency with industry-standard software but also my ability to weave cultural themes into futuristic contexts, marking a significant milestone in my creative and academic journey.</p>
